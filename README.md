# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jerry Anderson Huaynacho Mango**. I am a developer and currently a **Systems Engineering** student at the **National University of San AgustÃ­n**. I hold a bachelor's degree in **Civil Engineering**, with a specialization in structural engineering, which aligns closely with my interests.

Now that I'm studying Systems Engineering, my goal is to contribute with my development work in the field of civil engineering.

## Work Experience

Since 2020, I have been involved in the design of earthquake-resistant structures made of steel and reinforced concrete. I am also co-authoring an article soon to be published, which addresses structural health monitoring using artificial intelligence. Throughout my career, I have gained experience in modeling and designing structures. Thanks to my second degree, I have also acquired knowledge in object-oriented programming and proficiency in languages such as **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**. Additionally, I have worked on designing artificial neural networks using TensorFlow, and I am eager to contribute to the open-source community.
